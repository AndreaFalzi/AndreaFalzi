👋 Hi,

My name is Andrea, I live in Randers with my wife Aurora. We have three very cheerful and noisy bunnies 🐰.
My belief is that only with hard work and dedication can you get the best results. I am positive, honest and a great team player. I am ambitious and will never compromise on quality and results.
I like to work in a pleasant environment where people like to collaborate and fight for the same goal.
The passion for web development started a long time ago, but only in the last 3 years have I had the opportunity to learn it and grow as a skilled web developer 💻.

📫 If you are interested you can contact me @ af@andreafalzi.com or visit my website @ [andreafalzi.dev](https://www.andreafalzi.dev)
